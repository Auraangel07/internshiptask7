# 📊 Task 7: SQL Summary in Python using SQLite

## 🧠 Objective
This project demonstrates how to perform SQL queries inside Python using SQLite and visualize the results using Matplotlib.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- SQLite 
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

---

## 📂 Files
- `sales_data.db` – SQLite database with sample sales data
- `task7_summary.py` – Python script to run queries and plot data
- `sales_chart.png` – Revenue chart generated by script (optional)
- `README.md` – This file

---

## 🗃️ Dataset Structure
Table name: `sales`

| Column   | Type    | Description             |
|----------|---------|-------------------------|
| product  | TEXT    | Name of the product     |
| quantity | INTEGER | Number of items sold    |
| price    | REAL    | Price per item in INR   |

## 📌 SQL Logic Used in Python

```sql
SELECT 
    product, 
    SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity, 
    SUM(quantity * price) AS revenue 
FROM sales 
GROUP BY product;
```

## 📊 Output Visualization
A bar chart showing total revenue by product was generated using Matplotlib.

## 🎯 Learning Outcome
- Used SQLite inside Python to execute SQL queries
- Summarized product-wise sales
- Visualized results using basic bar charts
